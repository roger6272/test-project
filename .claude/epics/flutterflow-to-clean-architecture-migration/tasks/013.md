# Task 013: Deploy and Verify Items Feature

## Description

Deploy the completed Items feature to a test environment and verify all functionality works end-to-end. This includes testing CRUD operations, UI interactions, and Firestore integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Items feature deployed to Firebase project
- [ ] All CRUD operations verified working
- [ ] UI interactions tested on real device
- [ ] Firestore data persists correctly
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance acceptable (< 1s for Firestore queries)
- [ ] App doesn't crash during normal usage
- [ ] Memory leaks checked

## Technical Details

**Deployment Steps**:

1. **Build and run on device**:
```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --debug
flutter install

# iOS
flutter build ios --debug
# Install via Xcode
```

2. **Verify Firebase connection**:
- Check Firestore console for new documents
- Verify userId is correct in all documents
- Check Firestore security rules allow operations

3. **Test matrix**:

| Action | Expected Result | Status |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Load items on app start | Items load from Firestore | [ ] |
| Create new item | Item appears in list | [ ] |
| Update item | Changes persist | [ ] |
| Delete item | Item removed from list | [ ] |
| Toggle count view | Display switches | [ ] |
| Form validation | Errors shown correctly | [ ] |
| Empty state | "No items" message shown | [ ] |
| Error handling | Errors shown via SnackBar | [ ] |

## Dependencies

- Task 010: Items UI complete
- Task 011: Unit tests passing
- Task 012: Widget tests passing
- Firebase project configured

## Testing

**Manual Test Script**:

1. **Initial Load**:
   - Open app
   - Verify items load (or empty state shows)
   - Check loading indicator appears briefly

2. **Create Item**:
   - Tap FAB (+)
   - Enter name "Coffee"
   - Set increment to 1
   - Set reminder to "Target: 20"
   - Tap "Create Item"
   - Verify item appears in list
   - Check Firestore console for document

3. **Update Item**:
   - Swipe item left
   - Tap "Edit"
   - Change name to "Coffee Break"
   - Save
   - Verify name updated in list
   - Check Firestore console

4. **Delete Item**:
   - Swipe item left
   - Tap "Delete"
   - Verify item removed from list
   - Check Firestore console (document deleted)

5. **Toggle Count View**:
   - Tap calendar icon in app bar
   - Verify count display changes
   - Tap again to toggle back

6. **Form Validation**:
   - Try creating item with empty name → Error shown
   - Try name with 31 characters → Error shown
   - Verify valid input submits successfully

7. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Turn off WiFi/data
   - Try loading items → Error message shown
   - Turn on WiFi/data
   - Reload → Items load successfully

**Performance Checks**:
```bash
# Enable performance overlay
flutter run --profile

# Check for:
# - Frame rate: Should be 60 FPS
# - Jank: Minimal red bars
# - Memory: Stable, no leaks
```

**Firebase Console Checks**:
- Verify Firestore documents created with correct schema
- Check userId field matches authenticated user
- Verify timestamps are reasonable
- Check no orphaned documents

## Notes

- Test on both Android and iOS if possible
- Use real device, not just emulator
- Test with poor network conditions
- Check app behavior when backgrounded/resumed
- Verify no console errors in debug mode
- Take screenshots of successful flows for documentation
- If issues found, file bugs and fix before moving to next feature
- This is a checkpoint - Items feature must work perfectly before Bluetooth
